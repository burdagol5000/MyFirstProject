        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a group of Gamers from the Philippines that have bonded and decided to make a Guild at an Online game which was Cabal Online. At first it was just a game for us, but eventually as the years go by it became more of a brotherhood already. From that game we have transferred to other games 
            all together with the same Guild names and never left each others side. From that bond from a game we have bonbed
            also in real life, partying, chilling, celebrating members important days, travelling together and gaming together.
            But not all in life is about gaming, some had already important events happening in their life like family, that is why the 
            council leaders have put up some ideas to provide while also bonding. We have plans of contructing a gaming house for members to chill
            then also we will be providing some streaming facilities to members that are willing to stream for a monthly salary.
            As of right now we have a total of 60 members that are mostly at the Philippines and some had already migrated outside of the Philippines.
